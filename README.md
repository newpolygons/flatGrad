# flatGrad
Another neural network library in Python. I wouldnt use this. Looking to learn something here.


# Install
If you still are interested you can probably install by running the following commands.

    - git clone https://github.com/newpolygons/flatgrad.git
    - cd flatgrad
    - python3 -m pip install -e  .
